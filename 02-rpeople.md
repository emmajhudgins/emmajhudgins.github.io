# Current Students

## Erik Alonso - PhD Student

<img src="/assets/Erik.jpeg" alt="Justin along a beach" class="center-fit" width="500">

Erik's project is based around developing biosecurity best practices for the edible insect industry, funded by AgriFutures. The project aims to develop guidelines for best practice at the rearing and transport stages and develop suitability models to understand risk areas. Erik has a background in GIS with some experience with modelling. Erik has worked for Vic Government for the past 5 years or so, mostly with DEECA, but also in the emergency management space.

## Justin Kreller – MSc Student (co-supervised with Joe Bennett, Carleton University) 

<img src="/assets/justin.jpeg" alt="Justin along a beach" class="center-fit" width="500">


Justin joined the team in our inaugural semester (September 2023) after being selected for the [Weston Family Conservation Science Fellowship Program](https://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-we-do/conservation-research/weston-fellowship.html) at the [Nature Conservancy of Canada](https://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/). Justin's research, co-supervised by Dr. Emma J. Hudgins and [Associate Professor Joseph R. Bennett](https://carleton.ca/bennett-lab/), is focused on building models to map the distribution and forecast the spread of some of Canada's most invasive plant species in relation to landscape connectivity and climate change. The results of Justin's project will help forecast the future burden of invasive plants and inform land stewardship and conservation efforts across Canada. 
 
Like most biology students, Justin enjoys being outdoors and performing fieldwork, notably through recent work as a Student Biologist at the [National Capital Commission](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca). Justin also makes regular contributions to the [Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas](https://www.birdsontario.org), a project that has enabled him to take part in a canoe trip along the upper Winisk River as well as survey northeastern Ontario as a Wildlife Technician. It is this same passion for the environment that had pushed Justin to shift his career path towards conservation and pursue Fish & Wildlife Conservation Technician studies at Sault College (OCD, 2023) following his degree in Biomedical Mechanical Engineering from the University of Ottawa (BASc, 2020).  
 
Outside of school and work, Justin can be found practicing sports, birding, camping/hiking, reading, enjoying music, or walking his sweet German shepherd, Atlas. 


## Ruiting Qian - MEnvSci Student

I’m a 2nd-year Master of Environmental Science student. I did my undergraduate degree in Environmental Science as well here at Melbourne Uni. My interest in environmental conservation and climate change began during my undergraduate studies and has continued to grow throughout my master’s program. I’ve also learned some coding skills and am keen to incorporate both aspects into my studies and research. In my spare time, I enjoy playing and listening to music, as well as playing video games. 

*Ruiting's project involves modelling the spread of Myrtle Rust into Melbourne*

## Alex Muljadi - MSc Student (co-supervised by Prof. Margaret Mayfield)

<img src="/assets/Alex.jpeg" alt="Alex on a hike" class="center-fit" width="500">


My name is Alex, and I just started my masters of biosciences this semester with Emma as my primary supervisor.

I did my undergrad at Melbourne Uni majoring in genetics with a big interest in evolutionary genetics and exploring how species interact with the environment, each other, and how their traits change over time. At the same time, I took a lot of ecology subjects and developed an interest in population modelling and statistics. My other interests include reading, playing music (piano) and many natural/outdoorsy activities such as hiking, birdwatching and photography.

My research project is looking at using positive species interactions from exotic understory forbs to inform land management/conservation for the York gum woodlands. Specifically focusing on modifying species assemblages to support seed production, and then modelling the dispersal of those seeds in a fragmented habitat/landscape.

## Steven Myburgh - PhD Student (primary supervisor: Dr. Rebecca Runting, co-supervisor: Dr. Chris Baker)

<img src="/assets/Steven.jpeg" alt="Alex on a hike" class="center-fit" width="500">

Steven Myburgh is a PhD researcher conducting a socio-ecological systems modelling exercise around an invasive, fire-promoting species with conflicting values for stakeholders, in the northern Australian savannas. In particular, using a mixed methods approach, he is developing a combined behavioural-biophysical model of gamba grass, to model management and spread out to 2050, along policy-economic scenario trajectories. Steven's internal supervisors include Dr Rebecca Runting (primary), Dr Emma Hudgins and Dr Chris Baker.

Steven's academic interests include: interactions between global change drivers; biodiversity implications of habitat fragmentation and conservation in managed landscapes; implementation of multilateral environmental agreements and transdisciplinary research for sustainability. In his spare time, Steven likes food gardening, going on food adventures around Melbourne, learning new (and exotic) musical instruments and taking advantage of Victoria's natural assets by getting out into nature.

## Luca Reading - MEnv Student (co-supervised by Dr. Billy Geary)
<img src="/assets/Luca.jpg" alt="Luca on a hike" class="center-fit" width="500">

Luca Reading is in the second year of a Master of Environment degree at the University of Melbourne. While studying a Bachelor of Science with a major in Physics at Unimelb, Luca developed a keen interest in ecology. In particular, the impact of invasive species on Australia's native flora and fauna. This year, he joins the QAEco group at Unimelb under the supervision of Dr. Emma J. Hudgins and Dr. Billy Geary. Luca's research will focus on using spatial modelling and trait-based analyses to predict the potential impact of high-risk forest pest incursions on Australia's most vulnerable forest mammals. 

Outside of the university setting, Luca works as a high-school science tutor and science educator and is passionate about science communication. He also enjoys cycling, hiking, making noise on the drums and baking sourdough.

## Lucia Valdes Saucedo - PhD Student (co-supervised by Prof. Michael McCarthy)

<img src="/assets/Lucia.png" alt="Lucia on a hike with her dog (Duke)" class="center-fit" width="500">

My name is Lucia Valdes Saucedo, I am a PhD student at QAEco, University of Melbourne. During my Masters, I worked with community ecology and functional diversity in coral reefs. My main interests are statistics and mathematical modelling. I enjoy learning from other fields, so I also have basic knowledge of medicine, immunology, ethology, veterinary medicine, sexology, psychology, and other random areas. As part of my PhD, I am currently working with Emma and Mick to train a deep learning model to detect invasive species (plants) and estimate which visual features are most important for their detectability.

My tastes are very varied, but in general, I enjoy anime, manga, reading, walking with my dog (Duke), BTS, and documentaries.


## Luping Zhang - PhD Student (co-supervised by Prof. Michael McCarthy)

<img src="/assets/Luping.jpeg" alt="Luping at Disney World" class="center-fit" width="500">


Luping is a PhD student in QAEco, University of Melbourne. She has over five years of experience working in environmental management, ecological conservation, and policy-making. Her PhD research focuses on quantitative approaches to tree range shifts under climate change.

Luping enjoys bush walking, cycling along the coast, classical music, and browsing op shops. She is also a proud cat owner, with two cats named Science and Nature. Luping has witnessed the Great Migration in Africa. Next, she plans to see butterflies in the Amazon Rainforest and penguins in Antarctica.
