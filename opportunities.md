#Possible project ideas

#### Note: this is only a small list of ideas for projects. If you'd like to propose your own, please [get in touch](mailto:emma.hudgins@unimelb.edu.au). Importantly, I value excitement and curiosity over any pre-existing quantitative skills you may have, so don't shy away from getting in touch if you don't have a modelling or coding background.

## Urban tree risk mapping for the City of Melbourne


The [City of Melbourne](https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/community/greening-the-city/urban-nature/Pages/nature-in-the-city-strategy.aspx) are interested in understanding pest and weed threats that hamper their commitment to their Nature in the City strategy. Our aim is to produce a web app to visualise pest threats in the City of Melbourne as well as priority areas for management. This would be an extension of their existing [Urban Forest Map](http://melbourneurbanforestvisual.com.au). <br>

The City of Melbourne's urban tree inventory will be overlaid with pest and weed survey data, which will be fed into models to forecast future threat scenarios. The student will be in charge of building these pest spread and tree distributional models by extending models I've already published. All of these data and model outputs will be used to develop a web app in Shiny or similar for City of Melbourne residents to examine pest threats near them and inform municipal planning for urban plant health. We intend to make the web app available through the City of Melbourne's webpage and through an open source GitHub repository (or equivalent).


## Biosecurity best practices for the edible insect industry

Edible insects have been proposed as a solution to the increased need for protein in response to human population growth. The insect industry has the potential to become a [major rural industry in Australia](https://agrifutures.com.au/product/australian-insect-industry-rde-plan-2023-2028/) and provide a more sustainable alternative to traditional farming practices. However, the import and rearing of non-native insects for food and feed, like the import of any crop or livestock for agricultural purposes, is at risk of becoming a major pathway for the introduction of devastating invasive species into Australia's native ecosystems. To ensure this industry can deliver what it promises for sustainability while averting detrimental impacts on native biodiversity, we must understand the biosecurity risks of the insect industry and how to mitigate them. I am interested in developing a set of models of invasion risk of key potential agricultural import species such as the [black soldier fly](https://agrifutures.com.au/product/fact-sheet-small-scale-drying-methods-for-black-soldier-fly-larvae/) to understand their economic and ecological consequences. It will be key to understand the likelihood of establishment success outside rearing facilities, the extent and location of potential suitable habitat, and the locations of key native competitors in Australia. In doing so, we can begin outlining the highest-risk incursion areas to ensure that rearing facilities are planned for lower-risk areas.
