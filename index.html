	I use computational methods to study the ecology, impacts, and management of invasive species at large scales. I’m interested in uncovering broad generalities that emerge across species as a consequence of anthropogenic processes. I’m also interested in creating better forecasts of future invasion patterns, and better recommendations for invasive species management.<br><br>

My focus to date has been United States forest pests. During my PhD, I built models of invasive forest pest dispersal and establishment, urban tree distributions and pest-related tree mortality, and have used these models to project economic losses due to forest pests in urban areas. <br><br>


I am currently an FRQNT postdoctoral fellow in <a href="https://carleton.ca/bennett-lab/">Joe Bennett</a>'s lab at <a href="https://www.carleton.ca">Carleton University</a>. My postdoc project builds on my PhD work, but moves from descriptive to prescriptive, and shifts from the US to the Canadian context. The goal is to produce general rules of thumb for the best invasive pest management strategies, and for the budgetary balance between management and surveillance. I will use these rules of thumb to create an open-source tool for Canadian forests in collaboration with other lab members and Canadian government agencies, including Natural Resources Canada- Canadian Forest Service (NRCan-CFS), and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). <br><br>


In addition to my postdoc work, I’m part of the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/project/InvaCost-assessing-the-economic-costs-of-biological-invasions"> InvaCost project</a>. InvaCost is an up-to-date, global-scale <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00586-z"> data compilation </a> for economic cost estimates associated with invasive species. The project has gathered experts on various aspects of biological invasions to further take advantage of the database and analyze the data it contains. <br><br>
