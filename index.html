I'm interested in the ecology, impacts, and management of species that are changing their distributions due to humans. I work on the optimization of management and surveillance for species with dynamic ranges, including for invasive pests and trees undergoing climate-induced range shifts. I’m interested in creating better forecasts of future movement patterns, and better recommendations for invasive species management at large scales. <br><br>

I'm a part of the Quantitative and Applied Ecology group (<a href="https://qaeco.com">QAECO</a>) at the University of Melbourne within their newly formed School of Agriculture, Food, and Ecosystem Sciences (<a href="">SAFES</a>). <br><br>

I'm a recent arrival to UniMelb from Canada, and I continue to work in collaboration with Canadian government agencies, including Natural Resources Canada- Canadian Forest Service (NRCan-CFS) and Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). I have longstanding partnerships with researchers at the United States Forest Service (USDA-FS).<br><br>

I’m also a member of the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/project/InvaCost-assessing-the-economic-costs-of-biological-invasions"> InvaCost project</a> - a living <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00586-z">database</a> and working group that quantifies the economic toll of invasive species<br><br>

I was previously an NSERC postdoctoral fellow in <a href="https://carleton.ca/bennett-lab/">Joe Bennett</a>'s lab at <a href="https://www.carleton.ca">Carleton University</a>. <br><br>

I'm actively recruiting a team of engaged early career scientists who are looking to develop their quantitative skills. Take a look at my Research tab for any specific project opportunities available. Get in touch with me if you are a prospective Honours, Masters, or PhD student in search of a supervisor for an applied conservation project with a quantitative focus (no quantitative skills needed to apply!). If you're interested in doing a Postdoc with me, let's talk about how we can co-design a grant or fellowship application that's aligned with your goals!  <br><br>
